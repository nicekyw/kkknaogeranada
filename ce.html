	            <p class="text-center">Musical cognition: origins, traditional approaches, future directions
	            	<br>By Beatriz Ilari
				</p><br>
				<p>The study of the musical mind, called by many the study of musical cognition, requires the integration of several areas of knowledge because the very definition of the term is itself interdisciplinary (MAROTHY, 2000). Cognition is a term that comes from the Latin cogitare ("thinking") and has a direct relationship with the conceptual activities of the human brain and its verbal formulations while music, in turn, is defined as an aesthetic phenomenon involving the senses (aisthesis). , Greek term that originally means "to feel").
				However, as Marothy suggests, feeling and thinking are not exactly opposite processes, but interrelated, integrating musical experiences. However, practitioners in many fields have come together around the common ideal of understanding the musical mind,
				The study of these processes in relation to music is not at all simple and depends on a complementarity of studies from various areas and knowledge and requires great efforts on the part of the researchers involved.
				Dialogue between these professionals has never been easy, especially in the case of musicians and psychologists, while while the latter understand their humans as “mere perceivers,” the former exhibit a tendency to bring music to patterns of pitch, rhythm, and tempo.
				According to Marothy (2000), there is a great gulf between experimental studies of both music and psychology, and there is a pragmatic difficulty. That is, much psychological research is too “barren” and not easily applicable in practice, which most musicians consider of paramount importance.
				In the author's view, there is a lack of synchrony between the areas and research, this is what, in theory, students of musical cognition seek to search, which is a bit more complex in practice, especially considering the researcher's motivations for research. and the psychologist.
				This becomes easier to understand by tracing the origins of the study of musical cognition in the context of these distinct areas: musicology and psychology.
				Musical cognition in the context of musicology
				The study of musical cognition is one of musicology's specializations in the broad definition of the theme: systematic musicology, historical musicology and ethnomusicology.
				The boundaries between these disciplines are not so easy to draw, according to Parncutt, but some generalizations can still be made:
				Ethnomusicology and historical musicology tend to focus on specific musical manifestations from the study of plays, styles, traditions, written notation, musical performances, social and cultural contexts of music, often employing methods and research “borrowed” from areas such as history. , cultural studies and anthropology.
				While ethnomusicology tends to consider all music, historical musicology focuses primarily on the study of music noted by Western cultural elites (PARCNCUTT, 2007).
				In contrast, systematic musicology tends to understand music as a phenomenon, as having observable breakdowns in nature, but in different ways and in different contexts. That is, systematic musicology is concerned with the study of general and possibly universal processes related to musical experiences.
				In his text, Parncutt (2007) expands the metaphor of music as auditory cheescake (PINKER, 1998) to explain the main differences in approach to systematic musicology, historical musicology, and ethnomusicology. While the former (systematic musicology) refers to a top-down process, or, to general cake issues, historical musicology and ethnomusicology deal with a bottom-up process, a instead they provide details on the diversity of cakes found in various cultures and historical periods (PARNCUTT, 2007, p.3).
				From this definition, it is possible to state that studies of musical cognition have been located mainly in the subarea of musicology, systematically and more recently in some specific studies of ethnomusicology (see, for example, AROM, 2006; ESTIVAL, 2006).
				Musical cognition and systematic musicology
				The history of systematic musicology goes back to antiquity (PARNCUTT, 2007). Theories about musical scales, intervals, and the emotions they caused already existed in ancient Greece, China, and India, where these musical structures were often associated with mathematics and astronomy.
				Historical musicology, in his view, emerged during the Enlightenment and was strongly marked by rationalism and the idea of progress. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, historical musicology reached a prominent place for several reasons, including the idea of the superiority of western tonal music, as well as the importance that was given at the time to the creative talent, especially of composers and male musicians (see HOWE; DAVIDSON; SLOBODA, 1998; PARNCUTT, 2007).
				In the twentieth century also emerged critical musicology, comparative musicology and later ethnomusicology (Kerman, 1985). The latter quickly reached the rank of a third strand of musicology.
				Systematic musicology currently has the largest number and subareas, independent of all musicology. If on the one hand it has a quantitatively larger number and investigations, on the other it remains less defined than the others (PARNCUTT, 2007).
				According to Parncutt, in recent times, various ethnomusicologists define their work based on their approaches and research methods and not necessarily by the specific type of repertoire or musical culture studied, which gives them a strongly systematic character. In the second half of the twentieth century, the field of musicology became increasingly broad, diverse and also fragmented, and the strands of musicology (historical musicology, systematic musicology and ethnomusicology) continued to develop more or less independently.
				In an attempt to establish parameters, Parncutt (2007, p. 13) suggests that in the “real” universe of academic research, an area of knowledge is defined by the interests, knowledge, methods, and interactions among experts in the field. For him, the boundaries of an area are defined by the knowledge capacity of its researchers. For this reason, the task of categorizing systematic musicology is quite complex and controversial.
				Although there is no consensus among musicologists about the most appropriate categorization for systematic musicology, it is evident that the interest of musicians and musicologists in matters concerning musical cognition is not recent. However, it seems that recent developments in the so-called cognitive sciences have had a strong impact and possibly helped to accelerate musicological research on the musical mind even further.
				Nowadays, musicological research based on the study of musical cognition often converges to the same point where researches on music psychology are also found, becoming more evident in the evaluation the study of musical cognition in the context of psychology.
				Musical cognition in the context of psychology
				The study of musical cognition is situated, especially in the area of music psychology, defined by Gjerdingen (2002) as a branch of psychology that studies the way the mind responds, imagines and controls a performance and or evaluates music.
				Cognitive psychology was the dominant orientation that came to definitively replace behaviorism. Cognitive psychologists seek to determine how the mind works, initially by interpreting statistical data obtained through experiments (GJERINGEN, 2002).
				The emergence of cognitive psychology occurred at an extremely prolific moment when the so-called cognitive revolution was taking place.
				Cognitive Revolution: The Foundations of Cognitive Sciences
				The decade and 1950 was called by George Miller (1920) cognitive revolution for being a period and great reformulations and discoveries, when the “birth” of the cognitive sciences took place. At the same time as anthropology, psychology and linguistics were redefining themselves as areas of knowledge, new areas, such as computing and neuroscience, were emerging in the academic setting (VASCONCELLOS, 2007).
				Psychology, however, only participated in the cognitive revolution when it was able to disengage itself from the strong influence of behaviorism.
				Garner (2003) discussed the connections between the cognitive sciences, establishing strong and weak interdisciplinary links through and through a hexagon. According to the author, cognitive sciences were officially recognized in 1956, more specifically on 11 and September, when the Information Theory Symposium was held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
				Two articles of impact forever changed the course of scientific research on the human mind. The first article, entitled Logic Theory Machine, authored by Allen Newell (1927 - 1992) and Herbert Simon (1916 - 2001) presented the first evidence that computers were capable of solving theorems.
				The second article, Three Models for the Description of Language, by linguist Noam Chomsky (1928) demonstrated that language has the same formal precisions as mathematics and proposed a new view of grammar, which we now know as generative grammar.
				At the same event, George Miller presented the article Magic Number Seven Plus or Minus 2, which to this day influences studies on short-term memory limitations, including in computing.
				The ideas of Jean Piaget and Noam Chomsky, the discovery of neurons and the development of artificial intelligence helped support the idea of the mind as a complex modular system (harware) with special context adaptations(the software) that needed interdisciplinary efforts to be investigated. These ideas also influenced and changed the direction of the emerging area of music psychology.
				One of the first books in the field was published by Carl Seashore in 1938. In the late 1950s, two weekly publications gave rise to major developments in music psychology: Emotion and meaning in music published in 1956 by American theorist Leonard Meyer and La perception and la musique ”, published a year later by Frenchman Robert Francès, influenced an entire generation of researchers.
				Gjerdingen (2002) says that between 1960 and 1970, under the strong influence of Meyer and Francès, music psychologists focused primarily on studies of the nature of pattern perception in melodies. Outstanding researchers included Paul Fraisse, Diana Deutsch, Albert Bregman, and William J. Dowling.
				The next decade was marked mainly by studies of harmony and tonality. Some leading researchers of this decade were: Roger Shepard, Carol Krumhansl, Ernest Terhardt, Richard Parncutt, Fred Lerdahl, Eugene Narmour and Robert Gjerdingen among others. In Canada, psychologist Daniel Berlyne was devoted to the study of the so-called experimental aesthetics, while the English launched the journal Psychology of Music (1972).
				The next two decades can be characterized as a period of expansion in the field of music psychology. Between 1980 and 1990 some reference works were published, such as A generative theory of tonal music by Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff (1983). David J. Hargreaves's The Developmental Psychology of Music (1984), John Sloboda's The Musical Mind: The Cognitive Psychology of Music (1983) and Diana Deutsch's Psychology of Music (1984), as well as the American Psychomusicology (1983). - 2001) and Music Perception (1983).
				Other prominent researchers appear on the scene in the same decade as Jeanne Bamberger, Mary Louise Serafine, Eric Clarke, Irene Deliege, Sandra Trehub, Ian Cross, David Huron, Emmanuel Bigand, Stephen MacAdams, and many other research groups. are formed in Europe, North America, Korea and Japan.
				Since 1190, the field of music psychology has become even broader and a strong emphasis has been placed on the study of the musical brain and the emotions associated with music. In 2002, for example, Patrick Justin organizes and publishes, together with John Sloboda, the book Emotion and Music, and just a year later neuroscientists Isabelle Peretz and Robert Zatorre publish the book The Neurosciences of Music. More recently, Dorothy Miell, Raymond Macdonald and David Hargreaves organized the volume Musical communication (2002), and in 2005 Gary McPherson the compendium The child as musician, both examples of the crossing of distinct areas of knowledge that shed light on the study of music. musical mind in context. These are just some of the many examples available as search volume grows in geometric proportions.
				Convergences: systematic musicology, music psychology and musical cognition
				In the 1970s, empirical music research was directly linked to issues concerning the perception of acoustic properties of sound. According to Honing (2004), critics of the time said that such research sought to answer too “primary” questions of perception, using artificial stimuli and very little ecological warmth, as well as excerpts and musical pieces of Western classical music, often without seek to establish any relationships with their social and cultural contexts.
				Honing (2006) suggests that the cognitive revolution has raised these issues, making researchers more sensitive to them. Juslin and Sloboda (2001) argue that there has been significant growth in research on musical cognition, which has, for example, caused psychology, along with other traditional areas such as vision and language. However, musical cognition does not yet figure in music books.
				Nowadays, musical cognition has been defined as an area of interdisciplinary nature, which aims to understand the mental processes that underpin a wide range of musical behaviors such as perception, comprehension, memory, attention, performance and creation, among others (Levitin, 2006).
				In other words, musical cognition concerns the understanding of the psychological and physiological mechanisms that allow the existence of musical experiences (DAY, 2004). While music theory generally examines written musical materials, musical cognition analyzes music as a perceived phenomenon. However, these definitions are still under construction and are far from being consensual, since many "combinations" between areas and different theoretical contributions have been made (GJERDINGEN, apud DAY, 2004).
				Marothy (2000) goes so far as to say that the terms cognitive musicology and cognitive psychology of music are synonymous, and that the study of musical cognition results from a synthesis between linguistics (as Noam Chomsky's generative grammar), psychology (as the theory of Gestalt), neurosciences, and musicology (as through a revival of Schenkerian theory and computer research).
				According to the author, cognitive musicology is not a uniform research method, but a synthesis of several disciplines. Baily (1988), in turn, proposes an integration between the psychological and anthropological approaches to cognition. While Gjerdingen (2002) suggests that since the 1980s, the term musical cognition has replaced the term music psychology, especially in studies concerning the processing of musical information by the adult with typical hearing. For him, this change recognizes the diversity of subareas of psychology related to musical activities, such as music therapy, emotion psychology, developmental psychology, social psychology and learning psychology, among others. However, this definition is largely centered on the techniques used for data collection purposes. For this reason, it is not consensual among scholars.
				Levitin (in press) disagrees with Gjerdingen (2002) and defines music psychology as an area of research that focuses on the mental operations underlying hearing, musical practices, dance, and body movement in response to music and composition. , among others, always based on knowledge of the various disciplines of psychology (such as cognitive psychology, human developmental psychology, social psychology, applied psychology, etc.), cognitive sciences, music and music research conducted by the sciences. of life, social sciences and other humanities.
				According to Levitin, musical cognition currently ranks “first” in the ranking of the main areas of music psychology research in our times. However, it is important to note that the term musical cognition has been used to design the various mental processes involved, especially in the perception of musical structures, to a greater or lesser extent. However, as cognition permeates the various forms of musical making, that is, listening, appreciating, memorizing, creating, dancing, playing, improvising and singing, among others, and not just musical listening, this partially explains why most congresses of musical perception and cognition have a wide range of studies related to these subareas.
				That is, although the study of musical cognition has its origin mainly in the fields of psychology (and its subareas such as psycho-acoustics and psychophysics) and in one aspect of musicology, in recent years researchers from various traditional areas of the so-called cognitive sciences ( GARDNER, 2003) how neurosciences, computing, philosophy, linguistics and anthropology, among others, have joined forces to try to reformulate music theories in the human mind.
				In his recent book, Exploring the Musical Mind, Sloboda (2003) takes stock of 20 years in the field (since the publication of his seminal book, The Musical Mind, in 1983) and brings to light four themes that he considers to be most relevant to music. music psychology in the present times. Are they:
				    • cognitive processes in music
				    • emotion and motivation
				    • talent and skill development
				    • everyday music
				Looking at the terms proposed by Sloboda, we notice a strong tendency towards inter and transdisciplinarity, which is also occurring in other scientific areas around the world. In this sense, North and Hargreaves (2008) argue in the recently published The Social and Applied Psychology of Music that there was a significant change in the prevailing paradigm in music psychology in the 1980s, when the emphasis fell especially on cognitive psychology and psychology. of musical development. According to North and Hargreaves (2008, p. 9), music psychology has currently considered social and contextual factors, and recent research seeks to take into account both natural and experimental methods to “investigate the structure, content, objectives and implications of musical experiences ”.
				In other words, the study of the musical mind in the context of contemporary music psychology could be defined as the study of the musical mind in context. This obviously requires inter- and transdisciplinary efforts in areas that were not traditionally part of the cognitive sciences, as Gardener (2008) points out.

	            <p>“The World of Autism” released by Autism Speaks aims to help parents recognize early signs of autism inspired by stories of children with the disease.
				The viewpoint corresponds to the autistic child's perspective and the join attention are the illustrations that make up the narrative, which focuses on the signs that indicate the presence of autism and often go unnoticed for most people, including parents.
				The 3D stop-motion video begins the narration with the main character traveling along a river, symbolizing the journey of life. It portrays the story of a boy who didn't talk and liked things to be the same, because any empty change that made him scared. The unknown to him was a dangerous place, portrayed by images of a swamp, in which he tries to cross obstacles, symbolized by alligators, crickets with bright eyes and the sound of the owl in the background. These animals, from the boy's perspective, represented his fears (light and sounds).
				Reporting that he had built a secret place, the screen changes to a brighter field with animals symbolizing people, while he reveals that he cannot look into their eyes. So, the character enters a hole to go somewhere else, this time, he gets wings, which allows him to fly (metaphor for escape) because he has difficulties dealing with ordinary situations such as talking, looking into people's eyes and others. ordinary problems in a person's life. This excerpt from the video reveals concepts such as the low point, where the character goes through a conflict and reaches a turning point that allows him to overcome obstacles and move on.
				The hero's journey cycle (adventure call, assistance, departure, challenges, crisis, treasure, result, new life, problem solving) is used to show that the boy has overcome a difficulty, even though he has not solved the problem by complete: autism. Your journey begins with departure on a boat and ending with the return home. The mission is represented by the boy's special world, unknown to viewers.
				Until then, he had been locked in his own world. One day he discovered that he had autism, from then on the video ceases to be an animation and brings a real boy, a human, who continues the story and tells that, thanks to his family, he has found his “voice” and a better way to live.
				The narrative is produced based on the boy's memories and is constructed through a structure that presents the character without even naming him. We know that this is a special child, because its psychological characteristics are revealed throughout the video.
				The forest, which symbolizes dangerous places, and the imaginary animals that represent people, are signs of blending, as they refer to a third, figurative scenario. While the element of surprise is located in the last part of the animation: a mirror in the middle of the forest, in which a bird tries to peck at it. The camera also focuses on a triangular clock and there is a chandelier, which causes some strangeness and intriguing feeling about its symbology.
				Multimodality is represented by animation, the use of art resources to construct stop-motion, music, and other resources to awaken the senses. The soundtrack, in turn, is smooth, changing rhythm only at the moment it shows the swamp images to show distress.
