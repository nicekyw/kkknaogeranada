          <h4>What's a melody?</h4>
          <p>A sequence of sounds at irregular intervals. The melody walks between the rhythm and is usually the most outstanding part of the song, which oversees the singer or an instrument like Sax, a guitar solo etc. Whenever you hear solo notes, you will hear a melody.</p>
        </div>

        <hr>

        <div>
          <h4>What's a rhythm?</h4>
          <p>Defines how long each part of the melody will stay afloat. An example: “placid margins” of the national anthem, “plá” takes longer than “cidas”. That is the rhythm of the song.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>What's a harmony?</h4>
          <p>It is the simultaneous combination and pleasant grouping of sounds. You can play the song only one note at a time, but it would be bland. Therefore, the more chords (musical notes) played simultaneously harmoniously, the better the song will be.</p>
        </div>

        <hr>
        <div>
          <h4>What's musical chord?</h4>
          <p>The union of three or more notes played simultaneously. There are numerous possible combinations of notes, resulting in the most diverse chords. Each chord is named after the key notes we know (C, D, E, F, G, A, B). A chord may be major, minor or suspended (related to third degree)</p>

        <div>
          <h4>What's natural chord?</h4>
          <p>Some chords are called natural chords. Each is made up of three notes and there is a little rule to find out who those notes are. The notes that form the natural chords are the first, third and fifth degrees of their respective scales.</p>
        </div> 
        <br>  
        <hr> 
        <div>
          <h4>What's minor chord?</h4>
          <p>To form the minor chords, you use the minor third degree.</p>
        </div>
        <br>   
        <hr> 
        <div>
          <h4>What's major chord?</h4>
          <p>To form the major chords, you use the third major chord.</p>
        </div>
        <br>   
        <hr> 
        <div>
          <h4>What's suspended chord?</h4>
          <p>When the chord does not have the third degree, it cannot be classified as major, nor as minor, it is called "suspended".</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>What's Cipher?</h4>
          <p>
			It is notation to represent the names of the chords. The basic nomenclature is as follows:
			<ul>
			<li>C -> Dó</li>
			<li>D -> Ré</li>
			<li>E -> Mi</li>
			<li>F -> Fá</li>	
			<li>G -> Sol</li>
			<li>A -> Lá</li>
			<li>B -> Si</li>
			</ul>
			In a cipher, the chord name is given the name of the fundamental note (1 degree). That is, a chord formed by the triad C, E, G is called C (Dó).

          <h4>What's musical scales?</h4>
          <p>These are ordered sequences of notes. For example: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C, repeating this cycle. The scale started with the C note and followed a well-defined sequence of intervals until it returned to the C note again.</p>

        <div>
          <h4>What's duration?</h4>
          <p>Duration is represented by musical figures that change shape according to the duration of the sound. The symbols on a score never say, "Play such a note for so many seconds."</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>What's breaks?</h4>
          <p>These are time intervals in which there must be silence, ie no notes should be played at this time. There are breaks of semibreve, minimum, quarter note, etc.</p>

          <h4>What's intensity?</h4>
          <p>Intensity is a property of sound that allows the listener to distinguish whether the sound is weak (low intensity) or loud (high intensity). Also called loudness, it is related to the vibrating energy of the source that emits the sound waves. These, in turn, transmit energies that spread in all regions. The greater the energy the wave carries, the greater the intensity of the sound our ear perceives. It is like what we commonly call volume.
			In other words, the sound intensity corresponds to the force that the sound waves push the air and is measured in a unit called bel, named after the English scientist Granham Bell.
			The sub multiples of bel –1 decibel, = 1dB = 1dB = 0.1 bel, however, are more commonly used. From 140db appears the so-called limit of pain to the human ear. That is, the sound is hardly bearable by the ear and can cause damage to the hearing system.

          <h4>What's height?</h4>
          <p>The pitch of a musical sound depends on the number of vibrations, which is why we can distinguish a high (thin, high) sound from a bass (thick, low). While fast vibrations produce treble sounds, slow vibrations result in low sounds. These vibrations define one of the musical notes: C, D, E, F, G, A, B. Thus, the speed of the sound wave determines the pitch of the sound, so each note has its frequency (number of vibrations per second).
			The pitch of a sound can be characterized as defined or undefined, in both cases can be high or low. Instruments of indefinite pitch are unable to produce a melody because most of them make a single sound that the human voice or other instrument of definite pitch cannot reproduce.

          <h4>What's timbre?</h4>
          <p>Timbre is that which distinguishes the quality of the tone of voice of an instrument or singer. For example, the flute clarinet, the soprano tenor. Each object or material has a unique timbre, just as each person has their own voice timbre, as individual as fingerprints.

          <h4>What's time?</h4>
          <p>Compass - is a way of quantitatively dividing the sounds of a musical composition into groups. The measures facilitate musical performance by defining the unit of time, pulse, and rhythm of the composition or parts of it.
			It can be summed up by dividing a song into evenly spaced smaller parts. This division is based on the time (time) of the song).

          <h4>What's BPM?</h4>
          <p>BPM stands for Beats Per Minute, the term is often used to differentiate slower songs from faster ones. The more BPM, the faster the song will be. Many musicians use the BPM metronome to keep the tempo of the song always the same, as in the case of the drummer.

          <h4>What's Chord progressions?</h4>
          <p>Chord progressions are series of two or more chords used in a song, are represented by Roman numbers and designate the tonal degrees.

          <h4>What's progress?</h4>
          <p>Progress is the speed of a piece of music. A specific period is measured by a certain number of beats or time per minute. Each pulse is usually represented by a quarter note. This means that the music can be accelerated or delayed by changing its tempo, that is, playing a larger or smaller number of beats (times) per minute.

        <div>
          <h4>What's accident?</h4>
          <p>Musical accident is any note that does not belong to a certain scale or pitch. Take, for example, the major C scale: C, D, E, F, G, A, B.
			The C #, D #, F #, G #, A # scores are called accidents as they do not belong to this scale. As the C major scale has no sharp (or flat) notes, accidents all appear with these changes. However, if the scale in question were E major: E, F #, G #, A, B, C #, D #, the accidents would be the chords F, G, A #, C, D.
